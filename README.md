# Desktop Q – The Smart AI Desktop for People Who Live Online

**Desktop Q** is not trying to replace your OS — it’s trying to outsmart it.

It’s a web-based, AI-powered desktop layer for people who live in browsers, juggle tasks, and forget what they did 20 minutes ago.

No cloud. No bloat. Just a sharp memory, a chat box, and your favorite browser doing real work.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Web-Based Home Screen** – Your favorite sites front and center. Built for people who live online.
- **Expandable Chat Box** – Rewrites, edits, and summarizes with highlights. Hover any change to see what was altered and why. Add more inline.
- **Local AI Only** – All on your machine. Private, fast, no spying.
- **Browser Integration** – Uses *your* default browser to open new tabs and links.
- **Full Activity Memory** – Tracks everything you do or say. Recall actions, notes, chats, files — even from 5 years ago.
- **Pattern Recognition** – Notices trends. Example: “You searched Franck Muller watches 6 times this week — one’s on sale now.”
- **Smart Recall** – Ask anything like: “What idea was I working on last Thursday around 4PM?”

### 🧠 Example Use Case

You: "Buddy, open eBay, show me Franck Muller listings under $5k."

Q: Opens eBay in your browser, filters listings, and says:  
"You looked at this watch 6 times this week. A similar one just dropped on Chrono24."

Now that’s memory.
